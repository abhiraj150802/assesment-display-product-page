as per your instruction I have completed my project
and also it is responsvie not at expert level but I tryied my best to achieve this
brief description:

so this project will simply fetch data from the given url , and by default it will show men products and after that I have added  functionality to navigate from one category to other and add to cart button is only for dummy as stated

another functionality is , if there is badge_text i.e wedding special or offer or... i.e given in figma file will only show in top left corner of product card ,  if badge_text is not present i.e empty then it will  not show badge_text

and to show gender face in categroy button , I have used font-awesome

and also my page , heading , navbar and  product card -> all are responsive for mobile , tab and desktp

to run the program just run the html file as css and js is embedded in it
